## Overview

fast.ai is a framework to carry out deep learning in a variety of contexts using high, medium, or low-level APIs built on top of Pytorch. It is also a series of courses that introduce deep learning in a code-first manner.

In this workshop we'll take a tour of fast.ai, and then apply one of the first examples presented in the fast.ai courses to a real-world problem. We'll be using Google colab for compute. 

*NOTE*
When starting any colab session, be sure to select a GPU instance before beginning work. On the top menu, under Runtime, select Change Runtime Type and select GPU.
